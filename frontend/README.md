If you want to test the code you can start by cloning the repository here:

`https://github.com/erwaen/RemoteDevGuru.git`

To compile the project you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es "Node.js"), you can download it from the official website.
Once node.js is installed, open the project in your IDE's terminal or integrated terminal, switch to the frontend branch from git bash:

`git checkout frontend`

After changing branches we move to the frontend folder of the project:

`cd frontend`

Once in the folder, type the following command in the terminal:

`npm install`

to install the local web server and be able to view the project from the browser

The next step will be to execute:

`npm run dev`

To raise the server, then you can see the page at the url that you specify in the terminal, usually it is:

`http://localhost:5173`
