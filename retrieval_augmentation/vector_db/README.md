# **Document loader**

This Python script takes JSON documents generated by another
microservice that contains informations from LinkedIn and
other websites, vectorizes and stores that information in a
Pinecone database (a vector database).

## **Usage**

To build the docker image run the following command

```
docker build -t vector_db .
```

To run the image as a container you'll need to place the .env file in
the root directory and execute the following command

```
docker run -ti vector_db _file_name.json_ --env-file .env
```
